## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Pricing model is fixed packages (not credits) -- research summary references credits but PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md confirm packages
- Roadmap: Upsells (PAY-04/05/06) separated into Phase 6 after core flow, not bundled with base payment
- Roadmap: Phases 7/8/9 can execute in parallel (all depend on Phase 5 only)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged: Job queue selection (Inngest vs BullMQ vs Trigger.dev) needs evaluation during Phase 1 planning
- Research flagged: Eleven Labs API tier selection and rate limits need confirmation during Phase 4 planning
- Research flagged: Vercel function timeouts (60s Pro) may not cover full generation times (30s-2min)
